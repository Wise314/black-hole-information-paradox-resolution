## The Paper

This paper presents empirical evidence for a universal law governing information preservation in systems with recursive self-reference. Validated across 27 independent systems spanning five physical domains with 100% predictive accuracy.

## Key Discovery

A single thermodynamic equation predicts catastrophic failures across mechanical, electrical, aerospace, computational, and geophysical systems:

**Φ = I × ρ − α × S**

Systems with Φ < 0.25 fail. Systems with Φ > 0.25 remain stable. This threshold correctly predicted all 27 tested systems including 4 real-world catastrophic events.

## Validated Catastrophic Events

| Event | Φ Value | Outcome |
|-------|---------|---------|
| UK Power Blackout (Aug 9, 2019) | 0.178 | ~1 million affected |
| Tohoku Earthquake M9.1 | -0.357 | 18,000+ deaths |
| Parkfield Earthquake M6.0 | 0.114 | Confirmed |
| San Simeon Earthquake M6.5 | 0.084 | Confirmed |

All predictions made from pre-event data, not post-hoc fitted.
