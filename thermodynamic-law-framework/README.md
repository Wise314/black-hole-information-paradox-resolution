## 🔬 The Discovery

A single thermodynamic equation predicts catastrophic failures across mechanical, electrical, aerospace, computational, and geophysical systems:

**Φ = I × ρ − α × S**

- Systems with **Φ < 0.25** → Failure
- Systems with **Φ > 0.25** → Stable

One equation. One threshold. Five domains. 100% accuracy.
