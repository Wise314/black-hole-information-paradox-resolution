## 🔬 What This Paper Proves

- **Locally extractable energy follows E_loc = E₀√(1 − C²)** where C is the correlation resource
- **At maximum correlation (λ = 0.25), only 70.7% of energy is locally extractable**
- **The remaining 29.3% is stored in system-apparatus correlations**
- **Total energy is conserved** — what varies with measurement strength is access, not existence
- **Three experimental protocols proposed** testable with existing weak measurement technology

## 🔗 Connection to Other Papers

This paper builds on the triality framework from:
- [UQSD Triality Maximizer](../triality-maximizer-paper/) — derives λ = 0.25 threshold
- [Universal Identity Law](../thermodynamic-law-framework/) — empirical validation across domains

The 29.3% correlation energy matches the fraction appearing in black hole information dynamics under square-root dampening.
