## 📄 The Paper

The quantum mechanical derivation proving why λ = 0.25 is not an empirically fitted parameter — it's geometric necessity.

## 🔬 The Discovery

The wave-particle transition isn't a binary "collapse" — it's a continuous process through maximum triality residual.

Under UQSD (unambiguous quantum state discrimination) complementarity, the triality residual C² = 2√λ(1-√λ) is maximized at exactly **λ = 0.25**.

This isn't fitting. This is calculus. The value 0.25 is **geometrically forced**.
