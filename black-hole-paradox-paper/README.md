## Abstract

We prove that Hawking radiation dynamics uniquely require square root information dampening (I_accessible = √I_identity), resolving the black hole information paradox without firewalls, modifications to quantum mechanics, or new physics. The proof proceeds by constraint elimination: testing seven candidate functional forms against Hawking's acceleration constraint dM/dt ∝ -1/M², only √ scaling satisfies the physics while all alternatives fail. The specific selection of α = 1/2 follows from the relationship between Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S ∝ M²) and accessible information (I_accessible = √S). Empirical validation across computational, mechanical, and electrical systems achieved 100% accuracy (14/14 systems, Φ = 0.178 ± 0.02 for UK blackout prediction). Five falsifiable predictions testable in analog black hole experiments within 2-3 years.

## Key Insight: The Geometric Connection

The connection between black holes and the empirical validation systems (bearings, neural networks, power grids) is not analogical but **geometric**. All these systems share the structure of three-dimensional bulk information accessed through two-dimensional measurement surfaces:

| System | Bulk (3D) | Boundary (2D) |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Black holes | Spacetime interior | Event horizon |
| Bearings | Material volume stress states | Vibration sensor contact surface |
| Neural networks | High-dimensional weight space | 2D confusion matrix |
| Power grids | Network-wide dynamics | Frequency measurement interface |

This dimensional constraint—3D bulk projected onto 2D boundary—produces √ scaling as mathematical necessity, not empirical coincidence. The holographic principle, typically treated as specific to gravitational systems, applies universally to any system with this geometric structure.

## Key Results

### Theoretical Proof

- **Constraint elimination method:** Only √ dampening satisfies dM/dt ∝ -1/M²
- **All alternatives fail:** Linear (constant rate), logarithmic (decelerates), quadratic (→0), exponential (constant), cubic root (α=1/3), power 2/3 (α=2/3)
- **α = 1/2 derivation:** Follows from I_accessible = √(S_BH/S₀) relationship with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy

### Empirical Validation (100% Accuracy — 14/14 Systems)

| Domain | Systems | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Mechanical (CWRU Bearings) | 10 datasets | 10/10 correct predictions |
| Computational (AI Models) | 2 systems | 2/2 correct (Φ = -0.230 collapsed, Φ = 0.261 stable) |
| Electrical (Power Grids) | 2 systems | 2/2 correct (UK blackout Φ = 0.178 ± 0.02, Germany stable Φ = 0.401) |

- **Critical threshold:** Φc ≈ 0.25 discriminates failure/stable states
- **Probability by chance:** p < 0.0001 (14/14 correct)

### Paradox Resolution

- **Information preserved:** No unitarity violation
- **AMPS firewall dissolved:** Entanglement configuration never forms at any stage of evaporation
- **Page curve reproduced:** Natural consequence of √ dampening
- **Equivalence principle maintained:** No horizon modifications needed

### Falsifiable Predictions (2-3 year timeline)

1. **Three-point correlation:** C₃ = 0.316±0.05 vs 0.500 (linear) — 2.6σ
2. **Observer velocity dependence:** -0.43pp shift at v=0.5cs — 2.9σ
3. **Late-stage retention:** 31.6% vs 10% at M=0.1M₀ — 4.8σ
4. **Rate acceleration:** 3.16× increase (100%→10% mass) — **14.4σ** (strongest discriminator)
5. **Critical exponent:** β = 0.33±0.05 (3D Ising universality)

## Recent Updates (V22)
