## Overview

This paper argues that Hawking's equations (1975) mathematically exclude linear information transfer—the hidden assumption underlying the AMPS firewall paradox. The resolution requires no new physics, only correction of a premise that contradicts established physics.

Section 2.3 explicitly distinguishes mass, entropy, and information. The empirical validation is supporting evidence; the core argument is mathematical constraint elimination.

This guide addresses common questions; the arguments themselves are in the paper.

## Key Structural Points

**Acceleration Constraint:** Hawking radiation gives dM/dt ∝ -1/M². Linear, logarithmic, quadratic, and exponential transfer functions produce constant or decelerating rates. Only power laws with α < 1 satisfy the required divergence as M→0.

**Why Information Inherits the Mass Constraint:** Bekenstein-Hawking entropy scales as S_BH ∝ M². Information capacity is bounded by horizon area (holographic principle), horizon area is determined by mass, therefore information dynamics are constrained by mass dynamics. This is geometric, not assumed.

**Selection of α = 1/2:** Among power laws with α < 1, the value 1/2 is selected by Page curve timing (29.3% released at half-mass), holographic dimensional reduction, and cross-domain empirical validation. Three independent derivations converge.

**AMPS Resolution:** At the aggregate level, √ dampening means only 29.3% of information has escaped at Page time, not 50%. At the mode-by-mode level, each late Hawking quantum carries less of the unitarity burden, so the entanglement between late quanta and early radiation need not be maximal. The monogamy threshold is never reached. AMPS is dissolved—the paradox's premise was wrong.

**Why |dI_rad/dI| Must Diverge:** Both linear and √ dampening give |dI_rad/dt| → ∞ (because |dI/dt| already diverges). The Page curve requires back-loading: more information remains at any given mass fraction than linear transfer predicts. Back-loading requires remaining information I_hole ∝ (M/M₀)^α with α < 1, which gives |dI_rad/dI| ∝ I^(α-1) → ∞. Linear transfer (α = 1) gives uniform information-per-mass, contradicting Page.

**Geometric Origin:** The connection to empirical systems (bearings, neural networks, power grids, turbofans, seismic faults) is geometric, not analogical. All encode information in 3D bulk accessed through 2D measurement surfaces. When bulk dimensionality exceeds boundary dimensionality, √ scaling emerges from dimensional reduction.

**Empirical Validation:** Parameters α = 0.1 and Φ_c ≈ 0.25 were set once and applied across 27 systems in 5 domains with 100% predictive accuracy, including four real-world catastrophic events from pre-event data. This supports the framework but is not the core argument.

**Falsifiable Predictions:** Five numerical predictions testable in analog black hole experiments within 2-3 years. Strongest discriminator: information transfer rate acceleration (14.4σ separation from linear model).

## Known Errata

**Section 6.2 Notation:** The paper states "I_accessible = √(S_BH/S₀)." This is incorrect.

Since S_BH/S₀ = I² (where I = M/M₀), we have √(S_BH/S₀) = I, not √I.

The correct relationship is: **I_accessible = √I = (S_BH/S₀)^(1/4)**

Accessible information scales as the fourth root of normalized entropy. This is a notational error in the Discussion; the core derivation in Section 2 is unaffected.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does the paper conflate mass with information?**  
No. Section 2.3 defines I = M/M₀ (identity) as distinct from S ∝ M² (entropy). Section 6.2 derives their relationship.

**Q: Does the AMPS resolution address mode-by-mode entanglement or just aggregate flow?**  
Both. The aggregate argument is explicit. The mode-by-mode argument is implicit: per-quantum entanglement burden depends on total information distribution, which √ dampening changes.

**Q: Is α = 1/2 arbitrary?**  
No. The acceleration constraint eliminates α ≥ 1. Page curve timing, holographic geometry, and empirical validation independently select 1/2.

**Q: Why should I = M/M₀ inherit Hawking's acceleration constraint?**  
Because information capacity is bounded by horizon area (holographic principle), and horizon area is determined by mass. The relationship is derived, not assumed.

**Q: Why must |dI_rad/dI| diverge rather than just |dI_rad/dt|?**  
The Page curve requires back-loading. Back-loading requires α < 1. α < 1 gives |dI_rad/dI| → ∞. See derivation above.

**Q: Is the empirical validation the main argument?**  
No. It is supporting evidence. The theoretical derivation in Section 2 depends only on Hawking's equations and logic.

## Areas for Further Development

These are legitimate questions for peer review:

- The mode-by-mode AMPS argument could be more explicit in the paper.
- Empirical methodology (parameter setting, prospective vs retrospective) warrants documentation.
- The holographic derivation of √ scaling could be expanded mathematically.
- Section 6.2 notation should be corrected in revision.

## Document History

This guide was developed through adversarial dialogue with AI systems to identify likely objections before peer review. The process surfaced:

1. The Section 6.2 notational error
2. The need to justify I = M/M₀ as the correct variable
3. The |dI_rad/dI| vs |dI_rad/dt| distinction
4. The implicit mode-by-mode AMPS argument

All substantive objections were either answered or identified as areas for strengthening.
